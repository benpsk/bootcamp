## Introduction

We are excited to teach you the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. In this course we assume you know absolutely nothing about writing code.

Because this is a short course, we are not able to cover everything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web development exhaustively. Our goal is to teach you just enough to determine whether this kind of work for you. Do you enjoy it? Is it interesting?

If so, you'll be ready to dig into all of the resources the Internet offers, learning more on your own. **Completing this course will not fully prepare you to be a professional web developer.** You will need more practice with these concepts and more education. However, this course is an excellent start towards that goal.

## Prerequisites

We do assume that you have a basic grasp of how to operate your computer: how to browse the Internet, how to operate your operating system, how to use a keyboard and mouse, etc.

We also assume you have completed the Internet Fundamentals course, an introduction to important concepts like file management, the client and the server, and how the web works.

## Tips to Succeed In This Course

Contrary to what many people believe, you do not have to be a wizard with math to write code. The two subjects share some overlap but also are quite different. Many artists, lawyers, historians, linguists, and others have great success learning how to code. Don't let those preconceived notions hold you back at all.

Also keep in mind that this is _hard_. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you _should_ get something but don't. Keep your head up and keep trying. Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your problem to someone / your dog / a [rubber ducky][rubber-duck] Seriously, it works. Say it out loud.

Never feel afraid to Google _anything_. Every programmer you know, from the top person in the field to the newest student is Googling things _constantly_. This isn't cheating; it's a skill. It's a requirement. There is so much information coming at you that cannot possibly remember it all. Copy and paste code. Look at StackOverflow. Ask dumb questions. You get better by repeatedly exposing yourself to information. Each time a bit more will sink in.

Don't try to understand every piece all at once. There are times where it's okay to just trust that something works and come back later to understand how. It's a tough balance because you do want to try to understand what's going on. We will tell you what's worth diving into and what's worth leaving for another day. You don't have to understand it all at once.

Lastly, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Learning to code is hard and requires a lot of hard work. While entry-level jobs are out there, and you can get them with months of work, we guarantee you you'll have to work hard for them.
